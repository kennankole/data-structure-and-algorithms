#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together-ii/
'''
Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present 
in the array together in any place in the array.

Example 1:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 ways to group all 1's together: [1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap. 
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps. [0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap. The minimum is 1.

Example 2:

Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps are needed.

Example 3:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Constraints:

1 <= data.length <= 105
data[i] is either 0 or 1.
